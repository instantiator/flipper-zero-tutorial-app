# flipper-zero-tutorial-app

This is a simple app for the Flipper Zero, intended to accompany the Flipper Zero developer tutorials at: [instantiator.dev](https://instantiator.dev)

### Supporting references

A lot of the code here is derived from the work I did building the [resistance calculator](https://github.com/instantiator/flipper-zero-experimental-apps/tree/main/resistors) app, and you're welcome to sift through that code and plunder what you need for your own projects.

In turn, that app relies heavily on the patterns provided in Derek Jamison's [basic scenes](https://github.com/jamisonderek/flipper-zero-tutorials/tree/main/plugins/basic_scenes) tutorial. Derek has been kindly supporting and debugging my work in the background, and has produced a vast library of valuable learning resources.

### With thanks

This tutorial series would not have been possible without the help and support of various people in the Flipper Zero community. Many thanks to:
